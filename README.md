# Reeves_et_al_Eneuro_2022

# Use "FiguresAndStats.m" to reproduce the figures etc from Reeves et all 2022. You will need to load the following .mat files: saccade, trialTable, tables, and VarsForFigures.

# "AnalysisCode.m" is a bit outdated and can be largely ignored. It documents how "tables.mat" and "VarsForFigures.mat" are created and saved.
